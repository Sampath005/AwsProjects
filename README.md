CRUD Application Using API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and Python

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a simple RESTful API for performing CRUD operations on resources. The main components of this project are:

### API Gateway: 
It acts as the entry point for the API, allowing you to define the endpoints and connect them to AWS Lambda functions.

### AWS Lambda Functions: 
These are serverless functions that handle HTTP requests sent via the API Gateway. We have Lambda functions for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

### DynamoDB: 
A NoSQL database service by AWS used to store and manage the data for the CRUD operations.

### Python: 
The programming language used for implementing the Lambda functions.

## Usage

GET: Retrieve data or resources.

POST: Create a new resource or data.

PATCH: Update a resource with partial data.

DELETE: Remove a resource or data.
